# Lotto-Predictor

Created by: Vishaan Tiwarie

This app was created to assist lottery enthusiasts to choose the best numbers for selected lotteries.  
The app is currently still in development, and features are being added consistently.

HOW TO USE:

1. Use the dropdown to select a lottery.

2. Use the chart to decide which number to choose first.  The chart displays each possible number selection for the given lottery
and their existing frequencies in past winning numbers.

3. As you continue choosing numbers, the chart continually updates to show the frequencies of the past winning numbers
that includes the numbers you have chosen.  For example, if you chose "3" as your first number, the chart updates to show
the frequencies of each number where "3" was included in the draw.  If you choose "11" as your next number, the chart updates to 
show the frequencies of each number where both "3" and "11" were included in the draw, and so on .

FEATURES:
- App can be installed on devices with API level 11 and up.
- Choose between two lotteries (PowerBall and Cash4Life).  More to be added later.
- Fast, responsive charts.
